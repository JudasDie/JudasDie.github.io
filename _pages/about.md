**Biography**: Zhipeng received Ph.D degree from [Institute of automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA)](http://www.ia.cas.cn/) as of 2017. Before that he received the bachelor's degree at [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/) in 2017. He worked as an intern in [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.msra.cn/) in 2019.10-2020.6. He now works as a senior researcher at DiDi Voyager & KargoBOT.
